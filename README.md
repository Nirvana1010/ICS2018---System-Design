# ICS2018 Programming Assignment - System Design

**Language:** C

**OS:** GNU/Linux

**Compiler:** GCC

**CPU Architecture:** x64

## Overview

The fundamental way to understand "how a program runs on a computer" is to implement a complete computer system from scratch. A small project (Programming Assignment, PA) will present a pedagogical subset of the x86 architecture, the n86, and instruct students to implement a fully functional n86 emulator, NEMU (NJU EMUlator). Eventually, it will run the game "Legend of the Immortal Sword" on NEMU, The NEMU was designed to allow students to explore the basic principles of "running programs on a computer". NEMU was inspired by QEMU, and removed a lot of parts that differed significantly from the course content. The PA includes a preparation experiment (configuring the experiment environment) and 5 experiments:

- Simple debugger
- Von Neumann Computer Systems
- Batch processing systems
- Time-sharing and multitasking
- Program performance optimization

**[This project](http://nju-ics.gitbooks.io/ics2018-programming-assignment/content/) is the programming assignment of the class ICS(Introduction to Computer System) in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University.*

This is the completed version of PA. The following subprojects/components are included.
* [NEMU](/nemu)
* [Nexus-am](/nexus-am)
* [Nanos-lite](/nanos-lite)
* [Navy-apps](/navy-apps)
